## 📖 About the Project

The **SQL Grader using LLM** project leverages Large Language Models (LLM) to automatically grade SQL queries. It helps users learn and improve their SQL skills by evaluating and providing feedback on their queries in real-time. The system uses **Streamlit** for the front-end interface and **OpenAI API** for query evaluation.

➡️ A simple and powerful tool to enhance your SQL learning experience with AI-driven feedback!

## 🚀 How to Run Locally

1. **Clone the repository**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/<your-github-username>/sql-grader-using-llm.git
cd sql-grader-using-llm
```

2. **Run the application**
```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

3. **Access the Streamlit app**
```bash
http://localhost:8501
```

4. Interact with the SQL Grader

Enter a SQL query in the input box.

The LLM model will evaluate the query and provide feedback.

## 📈 What Happens Behind the Scenes?

- Streamlit serves as the front-end interface, allowing users to input SQL queries.
- OpenAI API evaluates the query and provides feedback on correctness, optimization, and best practices.
